Ask for help with installation,\r\n2. Discuss new features you're looking for,\r\n3. Let us know if we met or exceeded expentations!\r\n\r\nPre-requisites for Windows7\r\n===========================\r\n1. Download git from `http://git-scm.com/download/win` and install it\r\n2. Open `cmd`\r\n3. `git clone git://github.com/hakobera/nvmw.git \"%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\.nvmw\"`\r\n  1. If you are setup such that there is a `c:\\` drive and a `u:\\` user-drive mapped together then do NOT use `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`\r\n  2. Instead stick with absolute paths and use something like `git clone git://github.com/hakobera/nvmw.git \"c:\\dev\\.nvmw\"` etc.\r\n  3. And run `cmd` as an administrator\r\n4. `setx /M PATH \"%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\.nvmw;%PATH%\"`\r\n  1. or `setx /M PATH \"c:\\dev\\.nvmw;%PATH%\"`\r\n5. quit and start a new `cmd`\r\n6. Run `nvmw install v0.10.33` but thefirst time fails, second time will work so run it again: `nvmw install v0.10.33`\r\n7. Running `node --version` should spit out: `v0.10.33`\r\n8. `setx /M PATH \"%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\.nvmw\\v0.10.33;%PATH%\"`\r\n  1. or `setx /M PATH \"c:\\dev\\.nvmw\\v0.10.33;%PATH%\"`\r\n9. quit and start a new `cmd`\r\n\r\nPre-requisites for mac\r\n======================\r\n1. *TODO: Need to write up a \"spoon-feeding\" version of these instructions*\r\n\r\nHow to Install\r\n==============\r\n1. Make sure you have `git` and `nodejs` installed (`nvm`/`nvmw` is optional)\r\n2. `git clone https://github.com/ShoppinPal/vend-tools.git`\r\n3. `cd vend-tools`\r\n4. *[Optional]* Create `client.json` and `oauth.json` files so that you don't need to type in really long commands\r\n  1. You need your own vend credentials to make vend-tools work so goto https://developers.vendhq.com/ and `Register as a developer` then create a new application for yourself at https://developers.vendhq.com/developer/applications\r\n  2. Now you have two choices:\r\n    1. Use the tooling provided by the runscope website for getting Vend OAuth tokens: https://www.runscope.com/oauth2_tool\r\n      1. Authorize URL: `https://{DOMAIN_PREFIX}.vendhq.com/connect`      \r\n      2. Access Token URL: `https://{DOMAIN_PREFIX}.vendhq.com/api/1.0/token`\r\n    2. Or, you may refer to our example https://github.com/ShoppinPal/vend-oauth-example\r\n  3. Afterwards, the following sample `client.json` file template can be filled out and used:\r\n  ```\r\n  {\r\n    \"token_service\": \"https://{DOMAIN_PREFIX}.vendhq.com/api/1.0/token\",\r\n    \"client_id\": \"fill it in\",\r\n    \"client_secret\": \"fill it in\"\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n  4. Here's a sample `oauth.json` file template for you to fill out and use:\r\n  ```\r\n  {\r\n    \"access_token\": \"fill it in\",\r\n    \"token_type\": \"Bearer\",\r\n    \"refresh_token\": \"fill it in\",\r\n    \"domain_prefix\": \"fill it in\"\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n5. `npm install`\r\n6. `npm link`\r\n7. *[Optional]* Edit `settings.json` if you want to set a default output directory etc.\r\n8. Start using from anywhere in the command-line/terminal: `vend-tools`\r\n\r\nSimple-Legal-Speak\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThis is a labor of love. This effort is not funded, endorsed or sponsored by Vend.\r\n\r\nThis module is being written out of sheer respect for Vend's uncanny success at platformizing retail with their public API. It will hopefully help democratize access further by adding ease of use for developers. The authors of this module are not Vend employees and Vend didn't ask us to do this. Retail is a tricky/competitive space and we want to help reduce development churn, by open-sourcing pieces that allow folks to build iterative solutions. When in doubt, be sure to pay attention to the details expressed in the LICENSE file.\r\n\r\nWho are we?\r\n===========\r\n\r\nShoppinPal is a team of engineers and product guys with background in developing core systems at well-known Silicon Valley companies. We have deep expertise with Vend APIs. Several retailers use our ecommerce add-on, which works beautifully with Vend. We would love to assist you with any custom development needs that help you get the most out of Vend. We are listed in http://www.vendhq.com/expert-directory?region=0&service=12\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
